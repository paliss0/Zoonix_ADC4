Liskov Substitution Principle :
The Liskov Substitution principle was introduced by Barbara Liskov in her conference keynote “Data abstraction” in 1987. Barbara Liskov and Jeannette Wing formulated the principle succinctly in a 1994 paper as follows:

Let f(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then f(y) should be true for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
The human-readable version repeats pretty much everything that Bertrand Meyer already has said, but it relies totally on a type-system:

1. Preconditions cannot be strengthened in a subtype.
2. Postconditions cannot be weakened in a subtype.
3. Invariants of the supertype must be preserved in a subtype.
